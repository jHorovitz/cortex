**Machine learning infrastructure for developers: build  machine learning applications faster.**

Cortex is an open-source platform for building, deploying, and managing machine learning systems in production. It is designed for any developer who wants to build machine learning powered web services.

Cortex is actively maintained by Cortex Labs. We're a venture-backed team of infrastructure engineers and [we're hiring](https://angel.co/cortex-labs-inc/jobs).

## Key Features

- **End-to-End Machine Learning Workflow:** Cortex spans the machine learning workflow from raw data ingestion to prediction serving.

- **Scalability:** Cortex is designed to scale to datasets of any size.

- **Declarative Configuration:** Cortex applications are defined using a simple and modular syntax that enables flexibility and reusability.

- **Spark & TensorFlow Support:** Cortex supports custom [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/) code for data processing and custom [TensorFlow](https://www.tensorflow.org/) code for model training.

- **Built for the Cloud:** A Cortex cluster can be deployed on AWS in minutes.
